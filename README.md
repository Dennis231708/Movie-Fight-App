# Movie Fight App
This project lets you search for and compare two movies using data from the IMDb API. It's pretty cool - the app checks out a bunch of stuff like how many Oscars each movie won, their Rotten Tomatoes and Meta scores, and even their IMDb ratings and votes. It was a real eye-opener for me, teaching me loads about how we can grab info from APIs and how JavaScript helps us do cool stuff online.
